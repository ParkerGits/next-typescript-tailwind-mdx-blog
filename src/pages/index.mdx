Hey, I'm Parker! I'm a sophomore at Seattle Pacific University studying Computer Science and Applied Math, and I'm also a self-taught web developer. Welcome to my Digital Domain!

The term _Digital Domain_ stems firstly from the phrase ["digital garden."](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) Effectively, this site serves as _my_ digital garden. The only difference is that I've personalized the concept to suit an old nickname of mine. In high school, many of my friends called me **"Lord Parker"** (you can read about that <Link href="/posts/personal/the-origin-of-lord-parker">here</Link>). Thus, as one might tend to their garden, I tend to my territory... my _domain_.

The term _Digital Domain_ also accurately represents my relationship to the content on this site. As the benevolent lord of this land, I aim to write freely and abundantly here. Everything you see is a product of my own pursuits and passions. I rule the content of this site. I dictate the trajectory of my Digital Domain.

If you are interested in what I have to offer, or if you are interested in offering something to me, please visit my social media via the links provided below. Otherwise, check out <Link href="/list">all of my posts here</Link> or <Link href="/portfolio">my portfolio here</Link>.
