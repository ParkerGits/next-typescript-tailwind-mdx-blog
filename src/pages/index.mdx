My name is Parker Landon, and I am a student majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at Seattle Pacific University. Furthermore, through the SPU Honors Program, I am studying a variety of topics that constitute an _advanced liberal arts education_. I am very passionate about learning, and I hope to not only share some of my knowledge with readers, but also to learn from my writing and my readers. Some of my other passions, subjects that I will likely write about here, include programming, mathematics, data, tutoring, psychology, philosophy, and reading in general.

You are probably wondering how conceited I have to be to design my blog identity around the title _Lord_. I was endowed with the title during a high-school football practice. While the other offensive lineman and I were waiting around for instructions, one of the defensive coordinators approached us and began to casually chat. Eventually, the coach looked at me and exclaimed that, while he did not really know me, I looked like I spent my free time partaking in Live Action Role Play sessions and Dungeons and Dragons games. As I stood dumbfounded and trying to decipher whether what I had just heard was an insult, the coach yelled **LORD PARKER**. Without hesitation, my fellow offensive lineman followed: **LORD PARKER**! After that incident, the title spread quick. Soon enough, I was hearing the name _Lord_ from all angles in the hallways during school. Now, I use the title in my online identities to inspire unity and courage in my followers and fear in my opponents. I am the benevolent but powerful **Lord Parker**.

This blog is not only a personal writing project, but also a coding project. With the use of [this blog starter](https://github.com/joelhooks/next-typescript-tailwind-mdx-starter), this blog has been and will continue to be designed by me using Next, Typescript, Tailwind, and MDX. At the time of my writing, these technologies are very new to me. My ultimate goal is to improve in my web development, design, and general programming skills through pursuing projects like this blog.
