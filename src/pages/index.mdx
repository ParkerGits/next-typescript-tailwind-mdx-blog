My name is Parker Landon, and this is my Digital Domain. I am a student majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at Seattle Pacific University, and, through the SPU Honors Program, I am studying a variety of topics that constitute an _advanced liberal arts education_. I am very passionate about learning, and I hope to both share and acquire knowledge through the development of this site.

The term _Digital Domain_ stems firstly from an old nickname of mine. I've written about this nickname <Link href="/posts/personal/the-origin-of-lord-parker">here</Link>, but, to provide some context, many of my peers were calling me "Lord Parker" throughout my senior year of high school. Thus, the title _Digital Domain_ follows from the natural conclusion that every sovereign lord must have a domain.

_Digital Domain_ also accurately represents my visions for this site. I hope to write freely and abundantly here: to be the benevolent lord of this land. Everything offered here is a product of my own thoughts and passions. I rule the content of this site. I dictate what happens in my Digital Domain.

My Digital Domain is not only a personal writing project but also a coding project. With the use of <a href="https://github.com/joelhooks/next-typescript-tailwind-mdx-starter" target="_blank">this blog starter</a>, this site has been and will continue to be designed by me using Next, Typescript, Tailwind, and MDX. At the time of my writing, these technologies are very new to me. My ultimate goal is to improve my web development, design, and general programming skills by pursuing these kinds of projects.

Some recent developments to this website include:

- A Netlify function that automatically generates OpenGraph images (those images that appear on Twitter when I post my articles) from a query string.
