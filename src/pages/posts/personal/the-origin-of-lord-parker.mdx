I was endowed with the title of **Lord Parker** during a high-school football practice.

Specifically, this was a Thursday "walkthrough practice": a session aimed at patching up any errors in our formations and plays before the Friday game. As the receivers were running through their routes, we linemen stood chatting on the sidelines.

Eventually, one of the defensive coaches joined in on the conversation. The coach joked and teased and laughed with the group of lineman until finally he turned towards me and remarked that he had not yet gotten to know me well. My introverted self shrugged in response.

Then, rather suddenly, the coach exclaimed that I looked like I spent my free time partaking in sessions of Live Action Role Play and Dungeons and Dragons.

I then stood dumbfounded, trying to determine whether what I had just heard was an insult. Spontaneously, the coach yelled "LORD PARKER," and, without hesitation, my fellow lineman followed in unison.

After that incident, the nickname spread quickly. I first heard it only from my teammates at practice. Then, it began to catch on at school. Soon enough, I heard "Lord" from every direction in the hallways between classes.

Years have passed since the birth of the nickname, and my appreciation for it has only increased. While I have never regularly participated in the activities that my coach assumed I did, I have always partaken in hobbies that might be considered 'nerdy.' I also appreciate the irony: while the nickname accurately represents what I have observed in myself to be a natural tendency to lead, I am generally, despite the connotation, a humble, polite, and accommodating individual. I am happy to challenge the tyrannical stereotype associated with the title of 'Lord.'

So, as I work to lead and to inspire, it is with pride, not fear, that I have adopted this nickname and claimed this domain.
