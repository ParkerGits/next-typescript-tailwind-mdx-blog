The endowment of the title _Lord Parker_ occurred during a high-school football practice.

Specifically, this was a Thursday "walkthrough practice": a session aimed to patch any errors in our formations and plays before the Friday game. The receivers must have been getting most of the attention at that moment, as us linemen were standing around waiting for instructions.

Eventually, one of the defensive coaches made his way over to us and began to chat. Like the linemen, this coach had no business with the receivers. The coach joked and teased and laughed with the group of lineman until finally he turned towards me and casually observed that he had not yet gotten to know me well. My then introverted self shrugged in response.

Then, rather suddenly, the coach exclaimed that I looked like I spent my free time partaking in sessions of Live Action Role Play and Dungeons and Dragons.

As I stood dumbfounded, trying to determine whether what I had just heard was an insult, the coach yelled _LORD PARKER_. Without hesitation, my fellow offensive lineman followed the coach's exclamation in unison.

After that incident, the title spread quickly: first among my teammates, then across the school. Soon enough, I was hearing the name _Lord_ from all directions in the time between classes.

Two years have passed since the birth of the nickname, and my appreciation for it has only increased. My original affinity for it came from the seemingly universal recognition of its existence among my high-school peers. I also find it funny that, while I do not regularly participate in Live Action Role Play or Dungeons and Dragons, I was and still am what my coach observed me to be: a nerd.

I also appreciate the irony: I am generally a humble, polite, and accommodating individual despite the connotation of the title. However, _Lord Parker_ does accurately represent what I have observed in myself to be a natural tendency to lead.

Is it possible to break the stereotype of the tyrannical lord and to lead with benevolence?

It turns out that I am passionate about breaking stereotypes. In high school, I was determined to prove that I could be both a football player and an engaged student. I ended up graduating valedictorian from my high school and earning several recognitions and awards as a starting varsity offensive lineman.

Thus, I have gladly associated my online identity with the title _Lord_ and have made it my goal to defy the connotations surrounding it.

I hope not to rule but to inspire.

I aim to wield both power and benevolence.

I demand that this power stem not from oppression but proud discipleship.

I am the benevolent Lord Parker.
