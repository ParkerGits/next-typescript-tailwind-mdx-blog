## Introduction

This post consists of notes that I took while teaching myself SQL.

## üìó w3schools SQL Tutorial

The following information comes from the [w3schools SQL Tutorial found here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp).

### Definitions

- **SQL**: Structured Query Language
- **RDBMS**: Relational Database Management System
  - **Table**: A collection of related data entries. Consists of columns and rows. Broken up into fields.
  - **Field**: A column in a table that is designed to maintain specific information about every record in the table.
  - **Record**: Each individual entry that exists in a table. Also called a row.
  - **Database**: Contains one or more tables.
- **Statements**: Actions performed on a database.
  - Some of the most important SQL Statements:
    - **SELECT**: Extracts data from a database.
    - **UPDATE**: Updates data in a database.
    - **DELETE**: Deletes data from a database.
    - **INSERT INTO**: Inserts new data into a database.
    - **CREATE DATABASE**: Creates a new database.
    - **ALTER DATABASE**: Modifies a database.
    - **CREATE TABLE**: Creates a new table.
    - **ALTER TABLE**: Modifies a table.
    - **DROP TABLE**: Deletes a table.
    - **CREATE INDEX**: Creates an index (search key)
    - **DROP INDEX**: Deletes an index.

### Keep in mind...

SQL keywords are not case sensitive.

Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.

SQL requires single quotes around text values (most systems will also allow double quotes).

Numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes.

### SELECT Statement

Used to select data from a database.
The data returned is stored in a result table called the **result-set**.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
```

column1, column2, ... are the field names of the tables you want to select data from.

To select all fields available in a table, we use `*`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

### SELECT DISTINCT Statement

Used to return only distinct values.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column1 FROM table_name;
```

To list the number of distinct records in a field:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT column1) FROM table_name;
```

### WHERE Clause

Used to filter records. Extracts only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country='Mexico';
```

### AND, OR, NOT Operators

The `AND` operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by `AND` are `TRUE`.

The `OR` operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by `OR` is `TRUE`.

The `NOT` operator displays a record if the condition(s) is `NOT TRUE`.

### AND Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;
```

### OR Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;
```

### NOT Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition;
```

### ORDER BY Keyword

Used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.

By default, sorts in ascending order. To sort the records in descending order, use the `DESC` keyword.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
```

When using several columns with `ORDER BY`, the result-set is ordered by `column1`, but if some rows have the same `column1`, then it orders them by `column2`.

You can also sort one column by ascending, and another by descending:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 ASC, column2 DESC;
```

### INSERT INTO Statement

Used to insert new records in a table.

It is possible to write the `INSERT INTO` statement in two ways.

The first way specifies both the column names and the values to be inserted:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...)
```

Records in unspecified columns will have the `NULL` value.

If you are adding values for all the columns of the table, then column names do not need to be specified.

Make sure the order of the values is the same order as the columns in the table.

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...)
```

### NULL Values

A field with a `NULL` value is one with no value.

Optional fields will be saved with a `NULL` value if no value is added to the field.

Cannot test for `NULL` values with comparision operators (`=`, `<`, `<>`).

Instead, use the `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` operators.

### IS NULL Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;
```

### IS NOT NULL Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
```

### UPDATE Statement

Used to modify the existing records in a table.

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

The `WHERE` clause specifies which records should be updated. Without it, **all records are updated**.

### DELETE Statement

Used to delete existing records in a table

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

The `WHERE` clause specifies which records should be deleted. Without it, **all records are deleted**.

### TOP, LIMIT, or ROWNUM Clause

The `SELECT TOP` clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

Useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact performance.

Not all database systems support the `SELECT TOP` clause. MySQL supports `LIMIT`, while Oracle uses `ROWNUM`.

For an SQL Server or MS Access, the syntax is as follows:

```sql
SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

The following selects the first 50% of the records from the "Customers" table:

```sql
SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;
```

### MIN() and MAX() Functions

The `MIN()` function returns the smallest value of the selected column.

The `MAX()` function returns the largest value of the selected column.

### MIN() Syntax

```sql
SELECT MIN(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### MAX() Syntax

```sql
SELECT MAX(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### COUNT(), AVG(), and SUM() Functions

The `COUNT()` function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion.

The `AVG()` function returns the average value of a numeric column.

The `SUM()` function returns the total sum of a numeric column.

### COUNT() Syntax

```sql
SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### AVG() Syntax

```sql
SELECT AVG(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### SUM() Syntax

```sql
SELECT SUM(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### LIKE Operator

Used in a `WHERE` clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

Two wildcards often used in conjuction with the `LIKE` operator:

1. % - The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters
2. \_ - The underscore represents a single character

(MS Access uses an asterisk instead of a percent sign, and a question mark instead of the underscore)

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;
```

For example, the following would find any values that start with 'a':

```sql
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%'
```

Can also combine with the `NOT` operator:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City NOT LIKE 'a%'
```

### Wildcards

A wildcard character is used to substitute one or more characters in a string.

Used with the `LIKE` operator.

| SQL Server Symbol | MS Access Symbol | Description                                         | Example                                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| %                 | \*               | Represents zero or more characters                  | bl% finds bl, black, blue, and blob                            |
| \_                | ?                | Represents a single character                       | h_t finds hot, hat, and hit                                    |
| []                | []               | Represents any single character within the brackets | h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit                          |
| ^                 | !                | Represents any character not in the brackets        | h\[^oa\]t finds hit, but not hot and hat                       |
| -                 | -                | Represents a range of characters                    | c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt                                      |
|                   | #                | Represents any single numeric character             | 2#5 finds 205, 215, 225, 235, 245, 255, 265, 275, 285, and 295 |

### IN Operator

Allows you to specify multiple values in a `WHERE` clause.

Shorthand for multiple `OR` conditions.

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...)
```

We can also use `SELECT` within `IN`:

```sql
SELECT column
.. _name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (SELECT STATEMENT);
```

### BETWEEN Operator

Selects values within a given range (inclusive). The values can be numbers, text, or dates.

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
```

### Aliases

Used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.

Often used to make column names more readable.

Only exist for the duration of the query.

```sql
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
```

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name AS alias_name;
```

### JOIN Clause

Used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

The following example uses an `INNER JOIN` to select records that have matching CustomerID values in both tables, and then produce a table containing OrderID, CustomerName, and OrderDate columns.

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerID, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
```

Four different types of `JOIN`s in SQL:

1. (INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
2. LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table.
3. RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.
4. FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.

To `JOIN` Three Tables:

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Shippers.ShipperName
FROM ((Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)
INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID);
```
