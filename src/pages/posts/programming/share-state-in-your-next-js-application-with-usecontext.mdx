The picture above shows the visual scaffolding for a web development project that I am working on with members of the [egghead.io](https://egghead.io) Portfolio Project Club. You can read more about the specifics of this project [here](https://github.com/ParkerGits/tends/blob/master/README.md), but I'll provide some context in this post (no pun intended). üòÅ

My app **Tends** is a management app that lets users create a list of quantities that they would like to manage in their lives. These quantities are what I'm calling tendencies or "Tends," and are displayed for the user like this:

<Image
    src="/images/posts/share-state-throughout-your-next-js-application-with-react-usecontext-hook/parker-points-tend.png"
    width="1024"
    height="480"
    layout="responsive"
/>

The user can click the '+' button to be redirected to the "Create New Tend" form:

<Image
    src="/images/posts/share-state-throughout-your-next-js-application-with-react-usecontext-hook/create-new-tend-blank.png"
    width="1024"
    height="480"
    layout="responsive"
/>

In this form, the user can specify the **title** and **type** of their new Tend, as well as other properties related to the type of the tend.

    width="1024"
    height="480"
    layout="responsive"
/>

Since the Create New Tend form and the list of Tends are on separate pages, I needed a way for both to have access to the user's complete list of Tends.

My solution: React's `useContext` hook. üé£ü•≥

I start by creating a new **TendsContext.tsx** file in my **components** folder, and then I bring in `useState`, `useContext`, and `createContext` from React. I also bring in the types that I need since I am building this project with TypeScript.

### TendsContext.tsx

```ts
import { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react'
import { QuantityTendProps } from './QuantityTend'
import { TimerTendProps } from './TimerTend'
```

Now we'll initialize our context with `createContext`. I want to provide the pages in my app with the ability to get and set the user's list of tends. We'll create a component to manage the state of the list of tends next, but, for this initialization, we just need to give our context the necessary attributes. For me, these attributes are `tendsList` and `setTendsList`.

For TypeScript users: I define a type for my `TendsContext`, with `tendsList` being an array made up of the different kinds of tends (quantity and timer) and `setTendsList` being of type `any`. We want to use type `any` here because, while we initialize our context to undefined, this context will never actually be undefined in our program. You'll see why this is in the next step.

```ts
type TendsContextType = {
    tendsList: Array<QuantityTendProps | TimerTendProps>
    setTendsList: any
}

// Initialize Context
const TendsContext = createContext<TendsContextType>({
    tendsList: [],
    setTendsList: undefined,
})
```

Now we want to create a component that manages our `tendsList` and `setTendsList` state. I call this component `AppWrapper` since it's going to wrap around `<Component />` in `_app.tsx`.

Inside the component, we define our `tendsList` state with `useState`.

```tsx
export function AppWrapper({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
    const [tendsList, setTendsList] = useState<
        Array<QuantityTendProps | TimerTendProps>
    >([])
}
```

Now here's where the magic happens ‚ú®.

Notice that we provide this component with `{ children }` as props.

In the return of this component, we wrap the component's children with `<TendsContext.Provider>`. This will provide the component's children with the context we created.

Recall that we initialized our `TendsContext` with an object containing **tendsList** and **setTendsList** properties:

```tsx
const TendsContext = createContext<TendsContextType>({
    tendsList: [],
    setTendsList: undefined,
})
```

in the **value** prop of `<TendsContext.Provider>`, we specify the **tendsList** property to be the **tendsList** state of the `<AppWrapper>` component, and the **setTendsList** property to be function that sets that **tendsList** state.

```tsx
export function AppWrapper({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
    const [tendsList, setTendsList] = useState<
        Array<QuantityTendProps | TimerTendProps>
    >([])

    return (
        <TendsContext.Provider value={{ tendsList, setTendsList }}>
            {children}
        </TendsContext.Provider>
    )
}
```

Now all the children of the `<AppWrapper>` component are able to get and set the **tendsList** state!

Finally, to provide our Next.js application with this state, we wrap `<Component>` in **\_app.tsx** with our `<AppWrapper>` component.

```jsx
import '../styles/globals.css'
import { AppProps } from 'next/app'
import { AppWrapper } from '../components/TendsContext'

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
    return (
        <AppWrapper>
            <Component {...pageProps} />
        </AppWrapper>
    )
}
```

It's that simple! üéâ

Now any component in our Next.js application can access and change the **tendsList** state.

To actually gain access to **tendsList** and **setTendsList** in our components, we could export our `TendsContext` from **TendsContext.tsx**, import both `TendsContext` and `useContext`, and then use `useContext(TendsContext)`. ü§Æ

A more effective and efficient method is to export a function, call it `useTendsContext()`, from `TendsContext` that returns `useContext(TendsContext)`.

```tsx
export function useTendsContext() {
    return useContext(TendsContext)
}
```

Now we just have to import `useTendsContext()` in our component üß†.

```tsx
import { useTendsContext } from "./TendsContext";
...
const { tendsList, setTendsList } = useTendsContext();
```

For my use case, I'll be able to use `setTendsList` to add a new tend to the user's list when the Create Tend Form is submitted. üôå

```ts
setTendsList([...tendsList, newTend!])
```

(That exclamation mark following **newTend** is TypeScript's non-null assertion operator: a concept I learned while taking on this project with TypeScript's strict configuration. Read about the operator [here](https://medium.com/@tar.viturawong/a-note-on-typescript-non-null-assertion-operator-bad8fbe62bba)!)
