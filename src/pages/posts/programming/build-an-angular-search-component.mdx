## 🌟 About

These notes go along with the [Build an Angular Instant Search Component](https://egghead.io/courses/build-an-angular-instant-search-component) collection from [Christoph Burgdorf](https://egghead.io/instructors/christoph-burgdorf)

In this course, we use [Angular](https://angular.io/) and the [Wikipedia API](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php) to create a search component that displays Wikipedia articles related to a search input. Through these lessons, the viewer can expect to learn and apply

- RxJS ♾
- Observables in Angular 👀
- Operators ➗

My original notes can be found [here on my GitHub](https://github.com/ParkerGits/build-an-angular-instant-search-component-course-notes).

## 👩‍💻 Code

The code used in the course is of Angular ^2.0.0, and the code given in the [transcript](https://codesandbox.io/s/54xv161qq4?from-embed) is of Angular 7.0.3. **An updated version of the code can be found [here](https://github.com/ParkerGits/build-an-angular-instant-search-component)** _(updated 5/8/2020)_. The code for each lesson resides in the respective branch on the repository.

## 🍴 Consuming Events as Observables in Angular 2

### Creating a new Angular project

In order to create a new Angular project, first install [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) through npm in the terminal.

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Then navigate to a folder of choice in the terminal and run

```
ng new build-an-angular-instant-search-component
```

Routing is not needed for this project. Next, navigate to this project folder via

```
cd build-an-angular-instant-search-component
```

and run

```
ng serve
```

You can also clone [Parker's Angular Version 9 Respository](https://github.com/ParkerGits/build-an-angular-instant-search-component) for a project that works using the latest version of Angular (as of 5/8/2020). The code for each lesson resides in its respective branch. The following section details the changes made between the [transcript code](https://codesandbox.io/s/54xv161qq4?from-embed) and Parker's code.

### Dealing with Deprecation ⚠

Between Angular version 7 in the [transcript code](https://codesandbox.io/s/54xv161qq4?from-embed) and Angular version 9, a lot has deprecated.

The following are the changes that were made to the code above in order to get our search component working. The [resources](#resources) section contains resources detailing changes and updates to dependencies. And yes, the number of changes you need to make before your code compiles is reduced drastically after this lesson.

### app.component.ts

In the imports on line 3, we change

```js
import {Subject} from 'rxjs/Subject'
```

to

```js
import {Subject} from 'rxjs'
```

and on line 6:

```js
import 'rxjs/add/operator/map'
```

to

```js
import {map} from 'rxjs/operators'
```

On line 9, remove

```js
moduleId: module.id,
```

### app.module.ts

Replace line 4

```js
import {JsonpModule} from '@angular/http'
```

with

```js
import {HttpClientModule, HttpClientJsonpModule} from '@angular/common/http'
```

and line 10

```js
imports: [BrowserModule, JsonpModule],
```

with

```js
imports: [BrowserModule, HttpClientModule, HttpClientJsonpModule],
```

### wikipedia-search.service.ts

Change line 2 from

```js
import {URLSearchParams, Jsonp} from '@angular/http'
```

to

```js
import {HttpClient} from '@angular/common/http'
```

and line 3 replace

```js
import 'rxjs/add/operator/delay'
```

with

```js
import {map} from 'rxjs/operators'
```

Finally, our injectable, instead of looking like

```js
@Injectable()
export class WikipediaSearchService {
  constructor(private jsonp: Jsonp) {}

  search(term: string) {
    let search = new URLSearchParams();
    search.set("action", "opensearch");
    search.set("search", term);
    search.set("format", "json");

    return this.jsonp
      .get("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?callback=JSONP_CALLBACK", {
        search
      })
      .map(response => response.json()[1]);
  }
}
```

should look like

```js
@Injectable()
export class WikipediaSearchService {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}
  search(term: string) {
    let url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=opensearch&search=" + term + "&format=json"
    return this.http
      .jsonp(url, 'callback')
      .pipe(map(response => response[1]));
  }
}
```

With these changes, your code will be caught up with the instructor's code at the end of lesson one!

### Notes About This Lesson

- "Some people use a dollar suffix to indicate that a variable is an observable."
- The next lessons will teach us how to improve our application's efficiency and performance!
- When I used [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/) to edit my code, I would get [this error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44321326/property-value-does-not-exist-on-type-eventtarget-in-typescript/44321394). Try using a local Angular CLI project if you're having trouble with online code editors, too.

## ⏳ Debounce the user input in Angular 2 using debounceTime

### Dealing with Deprecation ⚠

debounceTime() is an RxJS operator, and RxJS operators are handled differently in RxJS 6.

We can import debounceTime in the same line as we imported map:

```js
import {map, debounceTime} from 'rxjs/operators'
```

Another change to RxJS operators is that they are applied through the .pipe() method. To learn more about .pipe(), take a look at [Using Operators in RxJS 6](https://academind.com/learn/javascript/rxjs-6-what-changed/#using-operators-in-rxjs-6). The code we write to apply .debounceTime() to our program is as follows:

```js
this.term$.pipe(debounceTime(400)).subscribe((term) => this.search(term))
```

### Notes About This Lesson

- Through debounceTime(), we can create gaps of time when our program will not update and effectively decreasing network usage.
- RxJS operators are very effective. It's all about finding the right one for the job. The official list and documentation of RxJS operators can be found [here](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/operators).

## Resources 📖

- [RxJS Operators Documentation](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/operators)

## ❌ Prevent unnecessary requests in Angular 2 with distinctUntilChanged

### Dealing with Deprecation ⚠

Like with debounceTime(), distinctUntilChanged() is an operator and will need to be handled differently in RxJS 6.

First, add distinctUntilChanged to your operator imports:

```js
import {map, debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged} from 'rxjs/operators'
```

Now, in the pipe method, add distinctUntilChanged() after debounceTime():

```js
this.term$
  .pipe(debounceTime(400), distinctUntilChanged())
  .subscribe((term) => this.search(term))
```

## Notes From This Lesson

- The RxJS distinctUntilChanged() operator filters out duplicate inputs and further decreases network usage.
- The RxJS .pipe() method allows us to list the operators that we will be "piping" to the Observable.

## 🌍 Combine Observables in Angular 2 with flatMap

### Dealing with Deprecation ⚠

Another operator has been introduced, and so it can be imported accordingly:

```js
import {map, debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged, mergeMap} from 'rxjs/operators'
```

In the lesson, he calls the method flatMap(). The operator is now only called mergeMap(), just like it is called on import. mergeMap is added to our .pipe() method like so:

```js
this.term$
  .pipe(
    debounceTime(400),
    distinctUntilChanged(),
    mergeMap((term) => this.service.search(term)),
  )
  .subscribe((results) => (this.items = results))
```

You can now remove the original search() function!

### Notes From This Lesson

- Using mergeMap() allows us to clean up our code by removing the needs for two .subscribe() methods. Read more on mergeMap [here](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/operators/mergeMap).

### Resources 📖

- [Parker's Updated Angular 9 Code (Lesson 4)](https://github.com/ParkerGits/build-an-angular-instant-search-component/tree/04-angular-combine-observables-in-angular-2-with-flatmap)
- [RxJS mergeMap operator](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/operators/mergeMap)
- [Using Operators in RxJS 6](https://academind.com/learn/js/rxjs-6-what-changed/#using-operators-in-rxjs-6)

## 🔄 Deal with out of order responses in Angular 2 using switchMap

### Dealing with Deprecation ⚠

Surprise, surprise! Another operator! To import, simply replace mergeMap with switchMap in your import:

```js
import {
  map,
  debounceTime,
  distinctUntilChanged,
  switchMap,
} from 'rxjs/operators'
```

and in the .pipe method():

```js
constructor(private service: WikipediaSearchService) {
this.term$.pipe(
  debounceTime(400),
  distinctUntilChanged(),
  switchMap(term => this.service.search(term)),
).subscribe(results => this.items = results);
```

Simple!

### Notes From This Lesson

- The instructor demonstrates the bug that a response for one search can potentially override the response for another.
- switchMap() allows us to get rid of this bug by automatically unsubscribing from the Observable that was previously mapped to.

## 👀 Build fully reactive APIs in Angular 2 with Observables

### Dealing with Deprecations (and other problems) ⚠

Last lesson! The operators copied from **app.component.js** need to be inserted in a .pipe method in the search function, like so:

```js
search(terms: Observable<string>, debounceMs = 400) {
    return terms.pipe(
    debounceTime(debounceMs),
    distinctUntilChanged(),
    switchMap(term => this.rawSearch(term))
  )
}
```

If you noticed, I passed debounceMs into debounceTime() instead of 400. I think this is what the instructor meant to do, anyway. Also, I wrote the function rawsearch() as rawSearch() - it just felt more natural!

Next, your Observable import should look like:

```js
import {Observable} from 'rxjs'
```

Instead of:

```js
import {Observable} from 'rxjs/Observable'
```

Finally, my imports in **app.component.ts** were not being shared application-wide, so I simply moved

```js
import {
  map,
  debounceTime,
  distinctUntilChanged,
  switchMap,
} from 'rxjs/operators'
```

to **wikipedia-search.service.ts**. If you know why this is the case, please contribute!

### Notes From This Lesson

- The ability to pass in Observables as arguments allows us to hide a lot of code behind a service!
