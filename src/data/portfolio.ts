    description:
      'I am producing an app called Knowted that streamlines student participation tracking for course instructors in the classroom. By integrating with the popular Canvas Learning Management System, Knowted centralizes student data with a dashboard and facilitates the quick and systematic selection of students for participation. Knowted enables professors to effortlessly grade student interactions and export those grades to the grade book. The application already benefits instructors as it sees growing usage among professors at Seattle Pacific University. The next step of this project is to expand beyond Seattle Pacific University and support instructors at other institutions.',

I created tends during an iteration of egghead.io\'s Portfolio Project Club, the goal of which was for each member to design, develop, and document a SaaS application that would serve as an impressive, business-oriented addition to their developer portfolio. Built using Next.js, React, TypeScript, Firebase, and Stripe, the project was my first stab at developing a full-stack application. Users could log into the service via GitHub or Google, and the application would store their quantities in the Firestore database. After finishing the project, I wrote and published a technical case study about my process.',

      'Serving as my final lab submission for the Data Structures 2 course at Seattle Pacific University, my C++ Huffman Coding Tree can encode, compress, and decode messages. The encoding process works by building a Huffman tree from a frequency table and using that tree to construct an encoding table. I use bitwise operations to convert binary strings to ASCII characters before outputting the encoded message and a string representation of the tree to a file. To decode the message, the embedded Huffman Tree is parsed and reconstructed from the encoded message. While I cannot share my code for this lab (it is still an assessment tool), I have provided pictures and my final grade report. This project represents the culmination of my C++ coursework and demonstrates my understanding of data structures and object-oriented programming.',

    description:
      'For ten weeks during the summer of 2022, I worked at Smartsheet as a full-time software engineering intern. The team I belonged to, Content Solutions, was primarily focused on developing the platform\'s "proofing" feature, which streamlines the iterative process of content creation by facilitating document versioning, feedback requests, and comments. My task over the summer was to implement a "due dates" feature for feedback requests to give requestors a better sense of when to expect recipient feedback. Before initiating the development work, I drafted a systems design document to receive feedback and continuously iterated on my plan. Once I was confident in my approach, I implemented the frontend components with TypeScript, React, Redux, and SASS, used Java Spring and MySQL to build the backend functionality, and used Docker to manage microservices during development. At the end of my internship, I presented the feature in a meeting open to all product development employees. Throughout this experience, I collaborated with managers, designers, user-experience researchers, and other engineers across all of Smartsheet\'s product development teams.',
